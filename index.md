# My discord bot in python

This is just a small project for our server.

Keep in mind that if you contribute some of the commit descriptions may not make sense for you, since we're hungarian.

## How?

The bot is developed fully in discord.py with the token hidden with PyCharm's venv.
We are currently "porting" to the new @bot.command method, instead of using if message.content == ("Whatever") for the commands.

Would be great if you helped us with that port.
